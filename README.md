## Project Description

Blockchain Certificate Issuer is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) built on the CORE blockchain that enables organizations to issue, store, and verify digital certificates securely using smart contracts. Leveraging the power of the ERC721 NFT standard, this project ensures each certificate is uniquely identifiable and permanently verifiable on-chain.

This solution is ideal for universities, training programs, event organizers, or institutions that require tamper-proof certificate generation, ownership tracking, and metadata transparency.

---

## Project Vision

We aim to create a trustworthy, decentralized, and scalable certification infrastructure for the Web3 world. With blockchain-based verification:

* *Authenticity is Guaranteed:* Each certificate is an NFT with immutable metadata.
* *No More Paper Trails:* All certifications are verifiable digitally and globally.
* *Tamper-Proof Records:* Ownership and data cannot be forged or lost.
* *Easy Verification:* Anyone can verify the validity of a certificate using just the token ID.
* *Decentralized Control:* No central authority is required for validation.

## Key Features

### Certificate Issuance

* Issue certificates as ERC721 NFTs
* Store metadata URI with each certificate
* Only contract owner can issue certificates
* Certificates are permanently owned by recipients

### Verification System

* Input certificate ID to fetch on-chain metadata
* View ownership and metadata in real time
* Publicly verifiable on any blockchain explorer

### Smart Contract Security

* Built using OpenZeppelin‚Äôs secure libraries
* Ownership control using `Ownable` contract
* Immutable record once certificate is issued
* Core network integration for low-cost transactions

### User-Friendly Interface

* Responsive React-based frontend
* MetaMask wallet integration for authentication
* Dark theme and mobile optimization
* Clean dashboard for issuing and verifying certificates

### Real-Time Feedback

* Get instant feedback on blockchain transactions
* Transaction pending and confirmed notifications
* Error handling and success modals included

---

## Future Scope

### On-Chain Certificate Templates

* Allow users to upload and select visual templates
* Include dynamic name/date injection on-chain

### Batch Certificate Issuance

* Enable bulk certificate issuance to multiple addresses
* CSV/JSON file support for uploading recipients

### Revocation System

* Implement on-chain revocation mechanism
* Mark specific certificates as revoked or expired

### Decentralized Identity Integration

* Integrate with DID protocols for certificate linking
* Verifiable Credentials (VC) support

### IPFS-Based Metadata

* Decentralized storage of certificate data using IPFS
* Add images, PDFs, and extended metadata

### Cross-Chain Verification

* Deploy contracts across multiple EVM-compatible chains
* View certificates on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, CORE, etc.

## Frontend Showcase

### Dashboard Features:

* **Connect Wallet** to CORE blockchain via MetaMask
* **Issue Certificate** using recipient address and metadata URI
* **Verify Certificate** using certificate ID
* **View Certificate** ownership and metadata in a sleek UI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* MetaMask browser extension
* CORE network configured in MetaMask

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CORECertificateIssuer.git
cd CORECertificateIssuer
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Smart contract setup
cd contracts
npm install

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment:

* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `contracts` folder
* Add your desired configuration values

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start local blockchain
cd contracts
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contract to local blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# Launch frontend
cd ../frontend
npm start
```
